"Develop solutions to help overcome challenges for senior citizens and PwDs (Infrastructure, ease of access to facilities, including medical, through technology)"
With this problem statement in mind and using the technological skills that we have, we came up with a mobile app named "AVANA". 

Avana in Sanskrit means protection. Hence this app, in its literal meaning is providing protection to those in need. This app helps in calling for any kind of help according to your condition and type of problem at the time. The application is easy to use since it is specially designed for senior citizens and physically specially-abled people.

Initially, the user has to sign in with their personal details such as name, age and their phone number. The user has to then answer a quick questionnaire about their willingness to help others, if they are PwD, and if they feel they need support when outdoors. 

The user will then be taken to the home screen, where a big blue button allows for easy and hassle-free calling for help. Additionally, one can choose from a list of options presented to them based on the kind of help they require.

The location of the person requiring help will then be broadcast to other users of the app, who can then acknowledge the request and know the location of the person in need, and can get to the person using Google Maps. On the other side, the person requiring help will be shown the details of the volunteer who can then be contacted.

Since this is a prototype, a lot of future research and development is possible. Future possibilities include adding a chat feature, showing real-time locations of people needing help with pointers on the map, gamification of the process by awarding points to most legitimate requirements of help attended to and so on.

Since this app uses the MQTT protocol, it is very easy to scale, and a database can be connected to this project for easier management of large sets of data. Due to the time constraint of the challenge, the aforementioned features are in the to-do list for the project.
